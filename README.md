I'm currently a co-founder of [Blush](https://blush.design), a tool that allows people to create, mix, and customize illustrations from artists around the world. We're a small team passionate about making illustration more accessible to everyone. 

Previously I worked at InVisionApp & Hulu. I'm a full-stack software engineer, passionate about web accessibility, performance, and infrastructure.
